# h20.io

![website landing page example](https://github.com/Jef-H/h20.io/blob/develop/img/mock_up.png)


This is a template project for playing with the google sheets API 

I thought I'd create a fun webpage to click every time I water my plants so I know that they're getting the proper hydration:)


Possible additons would be adding in gmail api functionality to send me an email when my plants need to be watered.
